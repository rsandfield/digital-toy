I have fond memories of playing Cosmic Osmo and the other early Cyan games on
my dad's Apple II computer. I was delighted to find that it had been ported and
made available on Steam so that I could share it with my own children. Sadly it
suffered for being a port of a port in compatability mode. Random bugs crop up
like the mouse or other elements disappearing, sounds get messed up, or the
game just freezes. Seeing how well Myst adapted to 3D, I thought Cosmic Osmo
might be well served by similar treatment.
